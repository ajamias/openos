    "\n",
    "In paraphrasing [Parkinson's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law), we observe that software programs have a tendency to expand to consume the available memory, and it's worth noting that modern home computers boast memory capacities that dwarf those from Larry's earlier days. As we explored in the introduction, memory, though swift, remains limited and costly when compared to storage. Moreover, it exhibits a volatile nature, with all alterations vanishing upon a system reboot. This brings us to the pivotal role of memory management within the operating system, which encompasses the allocation, release, and vigilant monitoring of memory usage. Memory management extends its purview to orchestrate the virtual memory for each running process, along with overseeing the allocation of physical memory across the entire system, thus ensuring its availability to various processes as dictated by their specific memory requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, most machines support paged virtual memory, but before we get into that, we need to explore how computers got where it is today. The first section describes the problems that early computers had using [physical memory](cont:mm:beforepaging). To address some of its problems, [segmented virtual memory](cont:mm:virt-seg), the first version of virtual memory, was created. Although segmented virtual memory solved some problems caused by physical memory, we tried to make virtual memory more efficient by developing [paged virtual memory](cont:mm:virt-paging), which allowed non-contiguous memory and memory capacity larger than what physical memory can contain. This is done with [page tables](page-tables), which is a data structure that facilitate fast memory access with the cache using [reclamation algorithms](cont:mm:reclamation).\n",
