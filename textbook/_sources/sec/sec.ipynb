    "# Security\n",
    "\n",
    "The term computer security covers a number of areas and goals. Most of\n",
    "them fall under the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Confidentiality of data. As a user of a computer system, this allows you\n",
    "to prevent others from accessing information which you wish to keep\n",
    "private, such as email or passwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Confidentiality of actions. This lets you prevent others from observing\n",
    "what programs you run and what files or external resources you access.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrity of data. Your data will not be modified or deleted without\n",
    "your permission.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrity of operations. Commands should do what they are supposed to\n",
    "do. For example, when you type ls you should get a directory listing,\n",
    "rather than a script that sends your passwords to a secret website in\n",
    "Russia.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Availability. A system will not stop running when you need it to be\n",
    "operational.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the rise of the Internet, security has become a much broader field,\n",
    "much of it related to either networking or the behavior of applications\n",
    "such as web browsers. This chapter will cover operating system features\n",
    "which enable computer security, and which reduce the risks from security\n",
    "flaws in application software; the field of computing security is much\n",
    "larger, however[^1].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Protection\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of security involves protection: deciding whether or not to allow\n",
    "an operation based on a series of rules. The purpose of protection is to\n",
    "ensure the security goals described above, by applying these rules to\n",
    "computing operations, allowing some operations and forbiding others.\n",
    "(This is not sufficient for full security, as seen in the discussion\n",
    "below of software vulnerabilities, but it helps.) These rules are\n",
    "typically based on a simple model, of actors, objects, and actions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Actors. These perform the actions. At the lowest level these are almost\n",
    "always processes, but they are typically identified by a text or numeric\n",
    "user ID, which is typically associated with either an actual person or a\n",
    "system service.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Objects. These are the things which are being protected: usually files\n",
    "or directories, but sometimes processes, special devices,\n",
    "configurations, or other aspects of the system which can be modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Actions. These are performed on objects. The most common actions are\n",
    "read and write, but others can include creating and deleting files,\n",
    "killing a process, or rebooting the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the operating system's protection or *access control*\n",
    "mechanisms is to express and enforce policies which determine whether a\n",
    "particular combination of an actor performing an action on an object is\n",
    "to be allowed or denied.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identity and Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Unix-like operating system, the actual actors are processes, which\n",
    "perform actions by issuing system calls. However specifying rules based\n",
    "on the processes themselves---e.g. process 10 may access file\n",
    "`\"/home/pjd\"`---will not work, because processes are created\n",
    "dynamically: rules could only be made for processes in existence at that\n",
    "time, and not for ones created in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution used in almost all operating systems today is the concept\n",
    "of *user identity*: every process is associated with a user identity\n",
    "(e.g. a user name and ID in Unix) and rules are specified in terms of\n",
    "these identities. In its simplest form each of these identities is a\n",
    "login name associated with an individual person, and rules for that\n",
    "identity are used to permit or restrict access by that person[^2]. User\n",
    "identity is inherited through the `fork` system call, so that actions\n",
    "taken by a process either directly or indirectly (through children of\n",
    "that process) are bound by the same rules. Access rules specify actors\n",
    "in terms of these identities, and every process is associated with one\n",
    "of these identities, allowing a fixed mapping from identities to\n",
    "permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{sidebar}\n",
    "These authentication mechanisms are frequently called *factors*; hence\n",
    "the term *multi-factor authentication*, where more than one factor (e.g.\n",
    "password, text message) are used. The Wikipedia entry on \"Multi-factor\n",
    "authentication\" is a good introduction.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice this requires a login process, or *authentication*, in which\n",
    "an external user proves that she has the right to take on a certain\n",
    "identity. Thus, the person Jane Smith may be given the right to use the\n",
    "operating system identity named `smith.j`, after *authenticating* that\n",
    "identity to the system by providing the correct password. Authentication\n",
    "is an important part of operating system security, as it forms the link\n",
    "between the higher-level goals of system administration (e.g. Jane is\n",
    "allowed to access *file.txt*, but Joe isn't) and the operating\n",
    "system-level features which implement this control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most authentication mechanisms can be classified as one of three types,\n",
    "based on the type of verification provided by the user:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Something you know*: e.g. a password. This is the most common form of\n",
    "authentication, due to ease of implementation.\n",
    "2. *Something you have*: like a key to a lock, an RSA SecurID token, etc.\n",
    "More complicated to administer, but more difficult for an adversary to\n",
    "obtain.\n",
    "2. *Something you are*: often biometric data, such as a fingerprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have undoubtedly used many password-authenticated processes; in\n",
    "addition you may have used other methods such as a SecureID token or\n",
    "fingerprint scanner. There are advantages and disadvantages to each type\n",
    "of authentication; however this class focuses on passwords as they are\n",
    "the most widely used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking passwords\n",
    "\n",
    "Securely storing and checking passwords is difficult, and various\n",
    "methods have been used over the years. The primary alternatives are as\n",
    "follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unencrypted file**: Passwords are stored In an unencrypted file, only\n",
    "accessible to the operating system or a privileged user, and a simple\n",
    "string compare is used to verify a user-entered password. Although in\n",
    "principle this should be secure, the result of any error or failure is\n",
    "catastrophic. (This issue is particularly problematic since people\n",
    "typically re-use passwords across systems.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hashed password file**: Passwords are put through a one-way\n",
    "cryptographic hash function[^3] before being stored. User-entered\n",
    "passwords are hashed by the same algorithm and compared with the stored\n",
    "password hash; if the two match, then the password is correct. Early\n",
    "UNIX systems used this mechanism, and made the password file\n",
    "publicly-readable, as the same file held other information (e.g. mapping\n",
    "between numeric user ID and text username) used by many unprivileged\n",
    "programs. (e.g. the **ls -l** command would need this mapping to show\n",
    "file ownership.) This was considered fairly secure on slow (and\n",
    "especially non-networked) machines, due to the length of time required\n",
    "to crack an individual password by *brute force*---i.e. trying all\n",
    "possible combinations until the correct password was found. However the\n",
    "discovery of *dictionary attacks* changed this, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary attack is based on the idea that in most cases breaking\n",
    "into *any* account is almost as good as breaking a particular account,\n",
    "and takes advantage of the fact that on shared machines (e.g.\n",
    "**login.ccs.neu.edu**) there are a large number of user accounts,\n",
    "increasing the chance of breaking into one of them. The attack consists\n",
    "of calculating the hash for every word in a dictionary[^4], and then\n",
    "comparing this list with the hashes in the password file; if *any* of\n",
    "the accounts has a password in this list, the attack succeeds. (a more\n",
    "sophisticated attack, using pre-computed *rainbow tables*[^5] is able to\n",
    "crack individual hashed passwords very quickly, as well.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Password \"salt\"**: This is a variation on hashed passwords---when a\n",
    "password is stored, a random string S is chosen (for unknown reasons\n",
    "called the *salt*) and appended to the password before hashing ; the\n",
    "stored value is then \\[S, hash(S+password)\\]. Verifying a password is\n",
    "straightforward: the salt value is read from the password file and\n",
    "appended to the input password before it is hashed and compared. This\n",
    "protects against attacks which require pre-computed tables (e.g.\n",
    "dictionary and rainbow table attacks), as now tables would be needed for\n",
    "every possible salt value. (in early usage this was 12 bits long; in\n",
    "modern systems it is 32 bits or more.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As machines (especially GPUs) become faster and faster, even this method\n",
    "has become less secure over time, as it is becoming feasible for\n",
    "attackers to evaluate billions of possible passwords per second.\n",
    "Counter-measures include making the hash function slower (e.g. running\n",
    "the password through the hash function 5000 times), and protecting the\n",
    "password file against public access, just like was done with early\n",
    "plain-text password files. (this is done in Linux--- `/etc/passwd`\n",
    "contains username and UID information, and is publicly readable, while\n",
    "`/etc/shadow` contains password hashes and is protected.\n",

    "although it is typically used over a network rather than for direct\n",
    "login. In this case the server must keep the password in clear text;\n",
    "when a client requests authentication, the server sends a\n",

    "\n",
    "Access Control Lists (ACLs) are explicit rules granting or denying\n",
    "access to users, and are more powerful than simple permissions. The idea\n",
    "is straightforward: an ACL is a list of rules, where each rule specifies\n",
    "a user or group, an action, and whether to allow or deny permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same example, which could not be encoded in standard Unix\n",
    "permissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "                file1   file2   dir1    file3\n",
    "        user1   ---     r--     ---     rw-\n",

    "        user4   rw-     rw-     ---     ---\n",

    "### Access Control List Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses OSX access control lists; however, Linux and Windows\n",
    "have similar mechanisms. We start with three user IDs: `pjd`, `guest`,\n",
    "and `joe`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First a file is created, made readable by all users, and an ACL rule is\n",
    "added denying access to user joe (using the chmod ---a command).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pjd$ echo 'file 1 contents' > file.1\n",
    "pjd$ chmod u=r,g=r,o=r file.1\n",
    "pjd$ chmod +a 'joe deny read' file.1\n",
    "pjd$ ls -le file.1\n",
    "-r--r--r--+ 1 pjd  wheel  16 Aug 28 14:20 file.1\n",
    " 0: user:joe deny read\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The file can now be read by both `pjd` and `guest`, but not `joe`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pjd$ cat file.1\n",
    "file 1 contents\n",
    "joe$ cat file.1\n",
    "cat: file.1: Permission denied\n",
    "guest$ cat file.1\n",
    "file 1 contents\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we create a second file, set it owner read-only, and a rule is added\n",
    "giving read access to `joe` but no other user:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pjd$ echo 'file 2 contents' > file.2        \n",
    "pjd$ chmod u=r,g=,o= file.2 \n",
    "pjd$ ls -le file.2\n",
    " -r--------+ 1 pjd  wheel  16 Aug 28 14:20 file.2\n",
    "     0: user:joe allow read \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the file can be read by `pjd` and `joe` but not `guest`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pjd$ cat file.2\n",
    "file 2 contents\n",
    "joe$ cat file.2\n",

    "### Other Privileged Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "Most Linux security checking is handled by a combination of the\n",
    "following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* File system permissions\n",
    "* Signal permissions\n",
    "    - A non-root process can only signal processes with the same user ID.\n",
    "* Super-user\n",
    "    - User ID 0 (traditionally named \"root\") may access any file or signal any process; dangerous kernel operations can only be performed if the current user id is 0.\n",
    "* Set UID\n",
    "    - This allows users to invoke functions with elevated privileges when appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Most security checking in Linux / Unix is handled by file system\n",
    "permissions. As an example, system utilities need direct access to the\n",
    "disk (e.g. to format a new file system); normal users are prevented from\n",
    "reformatting the disk by the permissions on the special file\n",
    "representing the disk device (e.g. `/dev/sd0`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix signals are primarily used to kill a process, and so are only\n",
    "allowed between processes with the same user ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "User ID number 0 (traditionally given the username \"root\") is allowed to\n",
    "bypass all user id-based permissions. In addition, certain system calls\n",
    "(e.g. mount a file system, reboot, install a kernel module) may only be\n",
    "performed by the super-user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the setuid permission flag on a file tells the kernel that when\n",
    "the file is executed it should take on the identity of the file's owner,\n",
    "not the user who invoked it. This is a simple mechanism which allows\n",
    "programs to make finer distinctions than the kernel does. For instance\n",
    "the `mount` program is owned by user \"root\", and marked *setuid*, as\n",
    "under certain circumstances a normal user may be allowed to mount a\n",
    "filesystem (e.g. when it is a removable drive). When the program is run\n",
    "by a normal user, it checks configuration files to see whether the\n",
    "request is authorized; if so it is able to invoke the mount system call\n",
    "as user ID root.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SELinux\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternate security mechanism available in Linux is called SELinux, or\n",
    "Security-Enhanced Linux. This is an enhancement to the normal Linux\n",
    "security model, which allows for exceptions to normal Linux rules. As an\n",
    "example, normal file permissions can still deny access to a file, but in\n",
    "cases where permissions allow access, SELinux rules might still forbid\n",
    "it.\n",
    "\n",
    "SELinux is based on rules about *domains* and *types*. A domain is an\n",
    "execution environment that users run programs in; a set of rules for a\n",
    "domain determine which users can run what programs within that domain.\n",
    "Files have types, and rules determine which domains are able to access\n",
    "which types of files. Finally, users can change domains by running\n",
    "certain programs; when this occurs is again determined by\n",
    "(unsurprisingly) another set of rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules are loaded into the kernel by a user-space policy process, and\n",
    "file types are determined by an SELinux context associated with the\n",
    "file, stored in file *extended attributes* in the file inode.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, the password file `/etc/passwd`\n",
    "contains usernames, groups, home directories, but not the hashed\n",
    "passwords themselves, which are in the shadow file,\n",
    "`/etc/shadow`; the shadow file may be modified when\n",
    "users run the `/usr/bin/passwd` program:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[root@localhost ~]# ls -Z /etc/passwd /etc/shadow /usr/bin/passwd\n",
    "-rw-r--r--  root   root   system_u:object_r:etc_t          /etc/passwd\n",
    "-r--------  root   root   system_u:object_r:shadow_t      /etc/shadow\n",
    "-r-s--x--x  root   root   system_u:object_r:passwd_exec_t /usr/bin/passwd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "One SELinux policy rule states that a user enters the\n",
    "`passwd_t` domain when executing a file of type\n",
    "`passwd_exec_t`; another states that processes\n",
    "running in the `passwd_t` domain have read and write\n",
    "privileges to files of type `shadow_t`. If SELinux is\n",
    "enabled, then even the superuser will only be able to modify\n",
    "`/etc/shadow` (and update your password) by executing\n",
    "`/usr/bin/passwd` or another executable marked\n",
    "`passwd_exec_t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actual SELinux policies are extremely complex, containing hundreds of\n",
    "rules; if you are interested in finding out more there are a number of\n",
    "tutorials on the Internet, including\n",
    "<http://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/Deployment_Guide-en-US/ch-selinux.html>\n",

    "### Control of Information Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "File access control is (somewhat) straightforward for an operating\n",
    "system to provide, as it represents a simple decision. If access is\n",
    "allowed, then the requested operation proceeds without interference; if\n",
    "it is denied, then the request fails completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, however, the desired restrictions are more subtle.\n",
    "Perhaps the earliest published example was a simple computer guessing\n",
    "game; the program would need to access the data to be guessed, while\n",
    "preventing the user from accessing it directly. Simple file permissions\n",
    "would not work, as if the game program were able to access the data\n",
    "file, then other programs (e.g. an editor) would be able to as well,\n",
    "allowing users to cheat.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general such a problem requires interposing higher-layer software\n",
    "between the user and the protected information. In Unix the *setuid*\n",
    "mechanism allows a user A to run a program as a different user B (e.g.\n",
    "root), by having the executable file owned by user B and setting the\n",
    "*setuid* permission on the file. This can be done in a way that user B\n",
    "has full access to the protected data, allowing the program to access\n",
    "the data on behalf of user A, but only in ways allowed by the program\n",
    "logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "In modern systems it is more common for such a gatekeeper role to be\n",
    "played by a server with access to the data, which accepts requests from\n",
    "users via messages and makes decisions on what data to reveal. Some\n",
    "examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "**MySQL**: This database accepts connections over a TCP socket; users\n",
    "log in and then are able to read and modify those tables they have been\n",
    "given permission to access, regardless of which files the data resides\n",
    "in. The MySQL process runs under a separate user ID, which is the only\n",
    "one able to access the underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Blackboard**: Connections to Blackboard are web sessions, controlled\n",
    "directly by users, and isolation of the data itself is ensured by\n",
    "preventing user access to the system that Blackboard runs on. The\n",
    "application logic enforces a complex set of rules governing what\n",
    "information each user may access; thus an instructor may see all grades,\n",
